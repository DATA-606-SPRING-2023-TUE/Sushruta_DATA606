## Introduction
American policymakers work to create economies that are more diverse and recession-proof. They are also aware that because to technological advancements, starting a business has never been easier than it is right now. Studies have shown that more Americans are choosing to start their own enterprises to achieve their financial goals, whether it's to achieve a better work/life balance, to pursue a passion, or as a result of losing their jobs. It is difficult for policymakers to research these "microbusinesses" since they are frequently too small or too new to appear in conventional economic data sources. However, data science might be able to close the gaps and offer insights into the elements that influence these organizations.

The [Venture Forward](https://www.godaddy.com/ventureforward/) team at GoDaddy has been working hard for the past few years to create data assets about the tens of millions of microbusinesses in the US. Microbusinesses are typically categorized as companies with ten or fewer employees and an online presence. More than 20 million of them, controlled by more than 10 million business owners, are visible to GoDaddy. You can access a wealth of information about this group of microbusiness owners that we have gathered over the course of several years of surveying them by accessing our survey data [here](https://www.godaddy.com/ventureforward/explore-the-data/?section=survey&cfips=6073).

Current models use econometric methods, draw on available internal and census data, and concentrate on comprehending primary factors. These approaches are sufficient, but there is room for improvement by adding more information and applying cutting-edge techniques to predictions and decision-making. GoDaddy is the biggest services marketplace for business owners worldwide. They have made it their mission to equip their community of more than 20 million customers—and business owners everywhere—with the resources and tools they require to succeed online. As they try to improve the world for microbusiness owners, policymakers will be better informed thanks to this work. This will have a real and substantial impact on communities across the country and will help our broader economy adapt to a constantly evolving world.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
The data collection process for microbusiness density in the US involved gathering information from the [Venture Forward website](https://www.godaddy.com/ventureforward/microbusiness-datahub/). Venture Forward serves as a comprehensive database that provides insights into the entrepreneurial ecosystem, including microbusinesses, across the United States. The website aggregates data from various sources, such as government reports, surveys, and business registries, to create a comprehensive picture of the microbusiness landscape.

To gather the data, relevant datasets and reports from the Venture Forward website were accessed and extracted. These datasets contain detailed information about microbusinesses, including their locations, industries, sizes, and other relevant attributes. The data collection process involved utilizing the U.S. Microbusiness Density data, U.S. Microbusiness Industry and Commerce and U.S. Microbusiness Activity Index.

By leveraging the Venture Forward website as the primary source of data, this study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of microbusiness density in the US. The utilization of this data source allowed for a robust examination of microbusiness trends, distribution, and other relevant insights, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the microbusiness landscape in the United States.

### Data preprocessing
Careful consideration was given to data quality and relevance. The collected data was evaluated for accuracy, completeness, and consistency to ensure reliable analysis. Preprocessing steps, such as data cleaning, were performed to address any inconsistencies or missing values within the dataset. Collected data was clean with no missing values.

## Data Analysis and Findings.
There are three datasets used in this project.
> U.S. Microbusiness Activity Index: In terms of microbusinesses, how vibrant and healthy is a community?
> The Microbusiness Activity Index, created by economists at the UCLA Anderson Forecast in collaboration with GoDaddy Venture Forward, keeps track of hundreds of variables that have an impact on the success of online microbusinesses and combines them into a single composite score.Infrastructure, participation, and engagement make up the three subindices that comprise the overall score. This score, which is updated every quarter, is used to compare one community to others and monitor the success of initiatives designed to support the growth of microbusinesses. The Index offers the most recent picture of the situation of microbusinesses at the local, regional, state, and federal levels. This dataset consisted of observation from April 2020 - June 2022.
