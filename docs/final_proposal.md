# Phase II: Data Preparation & EDA

**Data Cleaning:** In this step the data was cleaned and prepared for analysis. the dataset did not contain any missing values or outliers. The dataset was clean with no null values.

**Data Exploration:** In this step I checked if there is any correlation between the variables in every datset.
