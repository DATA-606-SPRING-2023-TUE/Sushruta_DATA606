# PHASE I: Project Proposal and Planning

## Topic: Analyse Microbusinesses in the US. 

### Motivation
This project is inspired from GoDaddy's Kaggle competition on [predicting monthly microbusiness density in a given area](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/godaddy-microbusiness-density-forecasting/overview). This will provide visibility on growing trends and, performance and health of microbusinesses; helping policy makers and investors.

### Problem Statement
Due to technological advancements, starting a business has never been easier than it is right now. Studies have shown that more Americans are choosing to start their own businesses to achieve their financial goals, whether it's to achieve a better work/life balance, to pursue a passion, or as a result of losing their jobs. American policymakers strive to build more diverse and resilient economies. Microbusinesses are frequently too small or too new to be included in traditional economic data sources, making it extremely difficult for policymakers to conduct research on them. However, data science could fill in the gaps and provide insights into the factors influencing these businesses.
